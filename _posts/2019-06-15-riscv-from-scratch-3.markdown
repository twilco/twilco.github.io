### Introduction

Welcome to the third post in the *RISC-V from scratch* series!  As a quick recap, throughout *RISC-V from scratch* we will explore various low-level concepts (compilation and linking, primitive runtimes, assembly, and more), typically through the lens of RISC-V and its ecosystem.

In [the first post of this series]({% post_url 2019-03-10-riscv-from-scratch-1 %}), we introduced RISC-V, explained why it's important, set up the full GNU RISC-V toolchain, and built and ran a simple program on an emulated version of a RISC-V processor.  In the [second post of this series]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}), we reviewed devicetree layouts, linker scripts, basic RISC-V assembly, minimal C runtimes, and more, all in an effort to understand how we get to the `main` function.

In the previous post, we used the `dtc` (devicetree compiler) tool to inspect the layout of various hardware components in the `virt` QEMU virtual machine.  Our intention at that point was to determine at what address the RAM lived within that machine, but you may also recall that `virt` had lots of other interesting components, one of which being an on-board UART.  In order to further expand our knowledge of RISC-V assembly, we'll spend this post writing a driver for this UART, exploring other important concepts such as ABIs along the way.

If this is the first post in this series that you are tuning into and would like to follow along, do not fret!  I'll provide step-by-step instructions to get you up and running quickly.

So, without further ado, let's begin.

### What is a UART?

UART stands for "universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter", and is a physical hardware device (_not_ a protocol, Ã  la [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) or [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)) used to transmit and receive serial data.  Serial data transmission is the process of sending data sequentially, bit-by-bit.  In contrast, parallel data transmission is the process of sending multiple bits all at once.  This image from the [serial communication Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication) illustrates this concept well:

{: refdef}

UARTs never specify a rate at which data should be received or transmitted (also called a *clock rate* or *clock signal*), which is what makes them asynchronous rather than synchronous.  Instead, UARTs use start and stop bits around each transmitted packet of data to inform the receiving UART of when to start reading data.

You may also be familiar with USART, which stands for "universal synchronous/asynchronous receiver-transmitter".  As you may guess, USARTs are capable of acting asynchronously in the same way UARTs do, but also come with the option of operating synchronously.  When operating synchronously, USARTs forgo the usage of the start and stop bits and instead transmit a clock signal on a separate line that allows transmitting and receiving USARTs to sync up.  Our driver will be for a UART, not a USART, so we won't dive into too much more detail on USARTs, but it's good to know of their existence and some basic differences.

UARTs and USARTs are all around you, even if you may not realize it.  They are built into nearly every modern microcontroller, our `virt` machine included.  UARTs and USARTs help power the traffic lights you stop at, the refrigerator that cools your food, the satellites that orbit the Earth for years on end...the list goes on and on.

### Setup

Before we get down to writing our driver, we'll need a few things setup to ensure we can properly compile and link.  If you've worked through the previous two posts in this series, you shouldn't have to do anything here, although you may want to make a copy of our linker script and runtime files in the new directory we create.

In the [previous post]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}), we customized the default linker script to expose a `__stack_top` symbol and created a minimal C runtime to perform basic initialization tasks, namely setting up the stack and global pointers and calling into `main`.  That post describes in detail why these things are important, but those details are unnecessary to continue on in this post, so feel free to simply download the necessary files here:

[crt0.s](/assets/crt0.s)

[riscv64-virt.ld](/assets/ld/riscv64-virt.ld)

Now that you have downloaded these files (or if you have them from the previous post), move or copy them into a new directory which will serve as the workspace for today's post.

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir -p ~/projects/riscv-uart
mv ~/Downloads/crt0.s ~/projects/riscv-uart
mv ~/Downloads/riscv64-virt.ld ~/projects/riscv-uart
{% endhighlight %}

You'll also need to have the GNU RISC-V toolchain and QEMU installed to facilitate compilation and RISC-V emulation.  Follow [these instructions](/riscv-from-scratch/2019/03/10/riscv-from-scratch-1.html#qemu-and-risc-v-toolchain-setup) from the first post in this series to complete this.

### Hardware layout in review

In the [previous post]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}), we used the `dtc` (devicetree compiler) tool to inspect the layout of various hardware components in the `virt` QEMU virtual machine.  Before we begin writing our driver, we'll need a little bit more information.  How do we configure the UART that's on-board `virt`?  At what memory address can we find the receive and transmission buffers?  Let's review the `uart` devicetree node to try and find some of this information:

{% highlight bash %}
# Install 'dtc' if you don't already have it.
brew install dtc
# Use qemu to dump info about the 'virt' machine in dtb (device tree blob) 
# format.
# The data in this file represents hardware components of a given 
# machine / device / board.
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -machine dumpdtb=riscv64-virt.dtb
# Convert our .dtb into a human-readable .dts (device tree source) file.
dtc -I dtb -O dts -o riscv64-virt.dts riscv64-virt.dtb
# Search for 'uart' and display 2 lines before and 6 lines after each match.
grep uart riscv64-virt.dts -B 2 -A 6
        chosen {
                bootargs = [00];
                stdout-path = "/uart@10000000";
        };
--
        };

        uart@10000000 {
                interrupts = <0x0a>;
                interrupt-parent = <0x02>;
                clock-frequency = <0x384000>;
                reg = <0x00 0x10000000 0x00 0x100>;
                compatible = "ns16550a";
        };
{% endhighlight %}

Great, there is lots of useful information in this snippet.  At the top we find a node called `chosen` which uses the on-board UART to display any output it may produce.  According to [this documentation](https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage#chosen_Node), the `chosen` node is special in that it doesn't represent physical hardware.  `chosen` is used to exchange data between firmware and a bare-metal program, such as an operating system.  We won't be using an operating system in this post, instead flashing our UART driver and a `main` function utilizing that driver directly onto the `virt` QEMU machine.

Next we find exactly what we're looking for - the `uart` node.  We see that this UART is accessible at memory address `0x10000000`, indicated by the `@10000000` portion of `uart@10000000`.  We also see `interrupts` and `interrupt-parent` properties, indicating to us that this on-board UART is capable of generating interrupts.

For those unfamiliar, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event needs immediate attention.  For example, a UART may generate an interrupt when new data has entered the receive buffer, when the transmitter has finished sending all data in its buffer, when the UART encounters a transmission error, and several other conditions.  These interrupts act as hooks so programmers can write code that responds to these conditions appropriately.  We won't be using any interrupts in this initial driver, so we'll skip these properties for now.

The next property down the list is `clock-frequency = <0x384000>;`.  [Referencing the devicetree specification](https://www.devicetree.org/downloads/devicetree-specification-v0.1-20160524.pdf), `clock-frequency` represents the frequency of the internal clock powering the UART (and likely the rest of the `virt` machine).  Remember that this is a UART, not a USART, so this clock is never output for others to consume.  The value is hexadecimal `0x384000`, which is `3686400` in decimal.  This frequency is measured in [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz), and converting this value to megahertz results in 3.6864 MHz, which is a [standard crystal oscillator frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator_frequencies).

Our next property is `reg = <0x00 0x10000000 0x00 0x100>;`, which determines the memory location of our UART and for how long its memory extends.  The `#address-cells` and `#size-cells` properties in the root node of our `riscv64-virt.dts` file are both set to `<0x02>`, which tells us it takes the addition of two `<u32>` cells to determine the address the `reg` begins at and two `<u32>` cells to determine the length the `reg` extends.  Given the values present in our `reg` field, our UART begins at memory address `0x00 + 0x10000000 = 0x10000000` and extends `0x00 + 0x100 = 0x100` bytes.  If this still is a little unclear, [the devicetree specification](https://www.devicetree.org/downloads/devicetree-specification-v0.1-20160524.pdf) explains in further detail.

This brings us to the last property in our `uart` node, `compatible = "ns16550a";`.  This property is particularly important, as it informs us what programming model the UART in question is compatible with.  Operating systems use this property to determine what device drivers it can use for a peripheral.  We don't have an operating system, but we are writing a driver, and this property tells us that if we write our driver in a way that is compatible with the ns16550a programming model, we'll be able to successfully interact with the UART.  Fortunately there are a litany of good resources showing all the details necessary to implement 16550-compatible UART, including [this one](https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/serial-uart.html) which we'll be referencing from here on out.

### Creating the basic skeleton of our driver

We have all we need to begin writing our driver, so let's begin.  Start by ensuring you're in the directory we created before with our C runtime and linker script:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/projects/riscv-uart
{% endhighlight %}

Now create a file called `ns16550a.s`, which will contain the code for our NS16550A UART driver.  In this file, let's start with a basic skeleton containing the functions we want to expose.  For now, we'll limit this driver to simply reading and writing chars, or bytes, without worrying about other available capabilities of the NS16550A such as interrupts.

{% highlight nasm %}
.global uart_put_char
.global uart_get_char

uart_get_char:
    .cfi_startproc
    .cfi_endproc

uart_put_char:
    .cfi_startproc
    .cfi_endproc

.end
{% endhighlight %}

Walking through this, we use the `.global` assembler directive to declare `uart_put_char` and `uart_get_char` as symbols we want accessible to other files that are linked with this one.  All lines that begin with `.`s are assembler directives, meaning they provide information to the assembler rather than indicating executable code.  Detailed description of all the basic GNU assembler (the `as` executable) directives can be found [here](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gas-2.9.1/html_chapter/as_7.html).

Next you'll see definitions of each of these symbols, currently only containing `.cfi` assembler directives.  These `.cfi` directives [inform tools](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33732119/2421349), such as the assembler or exception unwinder, about the structure of the frame and how to unwind it. `.cfi_startproc` and `.cfi_endproc` respectively signal the start and end of a function.

Finally we come to `.end`, which simply tells `as` that this is the end of this file.

In the spirit of rapid iteration, let's try to compile this against our custom linker script and C runtime.  If you're curious to know what all these flags are for, they are described in [great detail in the previous post]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}#debugging-but-for-real-this-time).  For now, just know we are passing our custom linker script, `riscv64-virt.ld`, custom C runtime, `crt0.s`, and NS16550A driver, `ns16550a.s`, to GCC to compile, link, and assemble for us.

{% highlight bash %}
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -g -ffreestanding -O0 -Wl,--gc-sections \
    -nostartfiles -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -Wl,-T,riscv64-virt.ld \
    crt0.s ns16550a.s
{% endhighlight %}

This should result in the following error:

{% highlight bash %}
/Users/twilcock/usys/riscv/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.02.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin/../lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-elf/8.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld: /var/folders/rg/hbr8vy7d13z9k7pdn0l_n9z51y1g13/T//ccjYQiJc.o: in function `.L0 ':
/Users/twilcock/projects/riscv-uart/crt0.s:12: undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
{% endhighlight %}

An utter disaster!  Taking a closer look at the error, this line tells us what we need to do:

{% highlight bash %}
/Users/twilcock/projects/riscv-uart/crt0.s:12: undefined reference to `main`
{% endhighlight %}

Taking a look at our `crt0.s` file, we do indeed see a reference to a symbol called `main`:

{% highlight bash %}
cat crt0.s

.section .init, "ax"
.global _start
_start:
    .cfi_startproc
    .cfi_undefined ra
    .option push
    .option norelax
    la gp, __global_pointer$
    .option pop
    la sp, __stack_top
    add s0, sp, zero
    jal zero, main
    .cfi_endproc
    .end
{% endhighlight %}

This is an easy fix - we simply need to link a file that defines the `main` symbol.  We would've wanted to do this anyways at some point, as we need some way to exercise our UART driver, and we can easily do so from `main`.  Create a new file called `main.c` in our working directory (`~/projects/riscv-uart`) and define a main function.  We'll also call `uart_put_char` to ensure that `main` is able to find our definition of it in `ns16550a.s`.

{% highlight c %}
int main() {
    uart_put_char();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And now try running `gcc` again, this time including `main.c`:

{% highlight bash %}
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -g -ffreestanding -O0 -Wl,--gc-sections \
    -nostartfiles -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -Wl,-T,riscv64-virt.ld \
    crt0.s ns16550a.s main.c
{% endhighlight %}

And this results in success!  We now have a file in our working directory called `a.out`, which is our (currently very useless) executable.  We can also use `nm` to see all of the symbols we've defined so far, including the ones we just created, `main`, `uart_get_char`, and `uart_put_char`.  If you haven't already, make sure you have the `riscv64` version of `nm` installed and available on your path, or linked into your `/usr/local/bin` folder.  [This section]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}#qemu-and-risc-v-toolchain-setup) in the first post in this series describes in detail how to accomplish this.

{% highlight bash %}
riscv64-unknown-elf-nm a.out

00000000800010a0 R __BSS_END__
000000008000109c R __DATA_BEGIN__
000000008000109c R __SDATA_BEGIN__
000000008000109c R __bss_start
000000008000189c A __global_pointer$
0000000088000000 T __stack_top
000000008000109c R _edata
00000000800010a0 R _end
0000000080000000 T _start
0000000080000018 T main
0000000080000018 T uart_get_char
0000000080000018 T uart_put_char
{% endhighlight %}

### Setting the base address

Now that we have the basic skeleton of our project all setup, let's dive into the actual NS16550A implementation.

Again referencing [this resource](https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/serial-uart.html), NS16550A UARTs have twelve registers, each accessible from some number byte offset off the base address.  We will be digging into these registers to implement `uart_put_char` and `uart_get_char`, but first we'll need to define a symbol representing this base address for use in our driver.  As we discovered from the decompiled devicetree file above, `riscv64-virt.dts`, the base address is located at `0x00 + 0x10000000 = 0x10000000`, as that is what is in the `reg` property:

{% highlight bash %}
uart@10000000 {
    interrupts = <0x0a>;
    interrupt-parent = <0x02>;
    clock-frequency = <0x384000>;
    reg = <0x00 0x10000000 0x00 0x100>;
    compatible = "ns16550a";
};
{% endhighlight %}

Let's define this symbol in our linker script, `riscv64-virt.ld`, since this is a good place to put details specific to the `virt` machine:

{% highlight bash %}
...more above...
SECTIONS
{
  /* Read-only sections, merged into text segment: */
  PROVIDE (__executable_start = SEGMENT_START("text-segment", 0x10000));
  . = SEGMENT_START("text-segment", 0x10000) + SIZEOF_HEADERS;
  PROVIDE(__stack_top = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM));
  /* >>>>>> Our newest addition. <<<<<< */
  PROVIDE(__uart_base_addr = 0x10000000);
  /* >>>>>> End of our addition. <<<<<< */
  .interp         : { *(.interp) }
...more below...
{% endhighlight %}

### A prologue to function prologues and epilogues

With our base address established and codified as the `__uart_base_addr` symbol, we now have a way to access our registers from our driver code.  Before beginning the true implementation of our UART functions, there is one more important topic we'll need to discuss: *function prologues*.

As you may know, in most high-level languages, variables that are passed into functions are stored on the stack.  While you may not realize it, the compiler or interpreter does a lot of work to make function calls seamless.  They save you from having to worry about:

1. How variables get saved onto the stack
2. Ensuring variables from one functions stack don't overwrite that of another functions stack
3. The mechanism for returning execution from the callee to caller when a function has completed
4. Cleaning up unneeded variables from the stack for functions that have completed

Today, we are the compiler, so we _do_ have to worry about these things!  Learning about this was one of my favorite parts of this blog post series, so strap in for a good time.

As you may guess, there is a standard solution for this standard problem: _function prologues_ and _function epilogues_.  Function prologues address the top two concerns, and function epilogues address the bottom two concerns.  This is what makes the function definition syntax in your language of choice so important - it will automatically insert the function prologue and epilogue for you in the assembly (or [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode), or [IR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation), or whatever) it generates.

There are two important registers we'll need to become familiar with: the stack pointer, `sp`, and the frame pointer, `fp`.  The stack pointer points to the next available memory location on the stack, and the frame pointer points to the base of the _stack frame_.  You can think of a _stack frame_ as a dedicated scratch space on the stack for variables passed in upon invocation of a function.

One important job of the function prologue is to establish this stack frame, and subsequently save variables passed into the function as an offset of the frame pointer.  If this is abstract and hard to understand, do not fear, for all will become clear when we actually implement our function prologue.  Speaking of which...

### Implementing a function prologue

Before implementing our function prologue, let's begin by altering our `main.c` file to pass a byte into `uart_put_char` so we have a parameter to work with.

{% highlight c %}
int main() {
    // 0b00000010 == 2 == 0x2
    uart_put_char(0b00000010);
}
{% endhighlight %}

We're now passing a variable into `uart_put_char` from our C program.  But wait, there is no such thing as functions in assembly...how do we get at this parameter from `uart_put_char`, an assembly symbol?

Answering this question requires us to learn about ABIs, otherwise known as application binary interfaces.  ABIs are conventions that standardize some very important things, such as the length of each data type (is an `int` 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits?), whether the stack grows up or grows down, and the expected [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention) that should be followed.  Calling conventions determine how functions receive parameters from their caller, and how they return a result back to their caller.  RISC-V has [quite a few ABIs](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/RISC-V_ABIs), such as `ilp32` (**i**nteger **l**ong **p**ointer **32**-bit) and `ilp32d` (**i**nteger **l**ong **p**ointer **32**-bit **d**ouble).  In all RISC-V ABIs, function parameters 0-7 are passed in registers `a0` through `a7`, with registers `a0` and `a1` also serving as the place for return values to be passed.  Also, in all RISC-V ABIs, the stack grows down from higher addresses to lower addresses, so from `0x88000000` down to `0x80000000` in our `virt` QEMU machine.

Hopefully this gives you an idea of why ABIs are so important.  If one function expects a parameter to be in register `a0` but it is instead put into `a7`, or if some functions grow the stack up and some grow it down, things just aren't going to work very well.

Bringing the discussion back to our `main` function, this means we know we can find the input parameter to `uart_put_char` in register `a0`, as that is what the ABI dictates.  And with that, we have all the information we need to implement our function prologue.  Let's begin!

Here's what the stack and registers might look like right before our `uart_put_char` function prologue:
