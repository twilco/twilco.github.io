### Introduction

Welcome to the third post in the *RISC-V from scratch* series!  As a quick recap, throughout *RISC-V from scratch* we will explore various low-level concepts (compilation and linking, primitive runtimes, assembly, and more), typically through the lens of RISC-V and its ecosystem.

In [the first post of this series]({% post_url 2019-03-10-riscv-from-scratch-1 %}), we introduced RISC-V, explained why it's important, set up the full GNU RISC-V toolchain, and built and ran a simple program on an emulated version of a RISC-V processor.  In the [second post of this series]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}), we reviewed devicetree layouts, linker scripts, basic RISC-V assembly, minimal C runtimes, and more, all in an effort to understand how we get to the `main` function.

In the previous post, we used the [dtc](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/disco/man1/dtc.1.html) tool to inspect the layout of various hardware components in the `virt` QEMU virtual machine.  At that point, our intention was to determine at what address the RAM lived at within that machine, but you may also recall that `virt` had lots of other interesting components, one of which being an onboard UART.

In order to further expand our knowledge of RISC-V assembly, we'll spend the next three posts writing a driver for this UART, deeply exploring important concepts such as ABIs, function prologues and epilogues, and low-level stack manipulation along the way.

If this is the first post in this series that you are tuning into and would like to follow along, do not fret!  I'll provide step-by-step instructions to get you up and running quickly.

So, without further ado, let's begin.

### What is a UART?

UART stands for "**U**niversal **A**synchronous **R**eceiver-**T**ransmitter", and is a physical hardware device (_not_ a protocol, Ã  la [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) or [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface)) used to transmit and receive serial data.  Serial data transmission is the process of sending data sequentially, bit-by-bit.  In contrast, parallel data transmission is the process of sending multiple bits all at once.  This image from the [serial communication Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_communication) illustrates this concept well:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<a href="/assets/img/riscv-from-scratch-pt-3/Parallel_and_Serial_Transmission.gif">![serial and parallel transmission contrasted](/assets/img/riscv-from-scratch-pt-3/Parallel_and_Serial_Transmission.gif)</a>
{: refdef}

UARTs never specify a rate at which data should be received or transmitted (also called a *clock rate* or *clock signal*), which is what makes them asynchronous rather than synchronous.  Instead, UARTs use start and stop bits around each transmitted packet of data to inform the receiving UART of when to start reading data.

You may also be familiar with the term "USART", which stands for "**U**niversal **S**ynchronous/**A**synchronous **R**eceiver-**T**ransmitter".  As you might imagine, USARTs are capable of acting asynchronously in the same way UARTs do, but also come with the option of operating synchronously.  When operating synchronously, USARTs forgo the usage of the start and stop bits and instead transmit a clock signal on a separate line that allows transmitting and receiving USARTs to sync up.  Our driver will be for a UART, not a USART, so we won't dive into too much more detail on USARTs, but it's good to know of their existence and some basic differences.

UARTs and USARTs are all around you, even if you may not realize it.  They are built into nearly every modern microcontroller, our `virt` machine included.  UARTs and USARTs help power the traffic lights you yield to, the refrigerator that cools your food, the satellites that orbit the Earth for years on end...the list goes on and on.

### Setup

Before we get down to writing our driver, we'll need a few things set up to ensure we can properly compile and link.  If you've worked through the previous two posts in this series, you shouldn't have to do anything here, although you may want to make a copy of our linker script and runtime files in the new directory we create.

In the [previous post]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}), we customized the default linker script to expose a `__stack_top` symbol and created a minimal C runtime to perform basic initialization tasks, namely setting up the stack and global pointers and calling into `main`.  That post details why these things are important, but that information is unnecessary to continue on in this post, so feel free to simply download the necessary files here:

[crt0.s](/assets/crt0.s)

[riscv64-virt.ld](/assets/ld/riscv64-virt.ld)

Now that you have downloaded these files (or if you have them from the previous post), move or copy them into a new directory which will serve as the workspace for today's post.

{% highlight bash %}
mkdir -p ~/projects/riscv-uart
mv ~/Downloads/crt0.s ~/projects/riscv-uart
mv ~/Downloads/riscv64-virt.ld ~/projects/riscv-uart
{% endhighlight %}

You'll also need to have the GNU RISC-V toolchain and QEMU installed to facilitate compilation and emulation.  Follow [these instructions](/riscv-from-scratch/2019/03/10/riscv-from-scratch-1.html#qemu-and-risc-v-toolchain-setup) from the first post in this series to complete this.

### Hardware layout in review

Before we begin writing our driver, we'll need a little bit more information.  How do we configure the UART that's onboard `virt`?  At what memory address can we find the receive and transmission buffers?

Let's review the `uart` devicetree node using the [dtc](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/disco/man1/dtc.1.html) tool to try and find some of this information:

{% highlight bash %}
# Install 'dtc' if you don't already have it.
# I use 'brew' for MacOS - you may need to do something else.
brew install dtc
# Use qemu to dump info about the 'virt' machine in dtb (device tree blob) 
# format.
# The data in this file represents hardware components of a given 
# machine / device / board.
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -machine dumpdtb=riscv64-virt.dtb
# Convert our .dtb into a human-readable .dts (device tree source) file.
dtc -I dtb -O dts -o riscv64-virt.dts riscv64-virt.dtb
# Search for 'uart' and display 2 lines before and 6 lines after each match.
grep uart riscv64-virt.dts -B 2 -A 6
        chosen {
                bootargs = [00];
                stdout-path = "/uart@10000000";
        };
--
        };

        uart@10000000 {
                interrupts = <0x0a>;
                interrupt-parent = <0x02>;
                clock-frequency = <0x384000>;
                reg = <0x00 0x10000000 0x00 0x100>;
                compatible = "ns16550a";
        };
{% endhighlight %}

At the top of our `grep` output, we find a node called `chosen` which uses the onboard UART to display any output it may produce.  According to [this documentation](https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Usage#chosen_Node), the `chosen` node is special in that it doesn't represent physical hardware.  `chosen` is used to exchange data between firmware and a bare-metal program, such as an operating system.  We won't be using an operating system in this post, instead flashing our UART driver and a `main` function utilizing that driver directly onto the `virt` QEMU machine.

Next we find exactly what we're looking for - the `uart` node.  We see that this UART is accessible at memory address `0x10000000`, indicated by the `@10000000` portion of `uart@10000000`.  We also see `interrupts` and `interrupt-parent` properties, indicating to us that this onboard UART is capable of generating interrupts.

For those unfamiliar, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event needs immediate attention.  For example, a UART may generate an interrupt when:

1. New data has entered the receive buffer 
2. When the transmitter has finished sending all data in its buffer 
3. When the UART encounters a transmission error

These interrupts act as hooks so programmers can write code that responds to these events appropriately.  We won't be using any interrupts in this initial driver, so let's skip these properties for now.

The next property down the list is `clock-frequency = <0x384000>;`.  [Referencing the devicetree specification](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/devicetree-specification/latest/devicetree-specification.pdf), `clock-frequency` represents the frequency of the internal clock powering the UART (and likely the rest of the `virt` machine).  The value is hexadecimal `0x384000`, which is `3686400` in decimal format.  This frequency is measured in [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz), and converting this value to megahertz results in 3.6864 MHz, or 3.6864 million clock ticks a second, which is a [standard crystal oscillator frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator_frequencies).

Our next property is `reg = <0x00 0x10000000 0x00 0x100>;`, which determines the memory location of our UART and for how long its memory extends.  The `#address-cells` and `#size-cells` properties in the root node of our `riscv64-virt.dts` file are both set to `<0x02>`, which tells us it takes the addition of two `<u32>` cells to determine the address the `reg` begins at and two `<u32>` cells to determine the length the `reg` extends.  Given the values present in our `reg` field, we know our UART registers begin at memory address `0x00 + 0x10000000 = 0x10000000` and extend `0x00 + 0x100 = 0x100` bytes.  If this still is a little unclear, you can read about these properties in [the devicetree specification](https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/devicetree-specification/latest/devicetree-specification.pdf).

This brings us to the last property in our `uart` node, `compatible = "ns16550a";`.  This property is particularly important, as it informs us what programming model the UART in question is compatible with.  Operating systems use this property to determine what device drivers it can use for a peripheral.  There are a litany of good resources showing all the details necessary to implement a NS16550A-compatible UART, including [this one](https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/serial-uart.html) which we'll be referencing from here on out.

### Creating the basic skeleton of our driver

We have all we need to begin writing our driver, so let's begin.  Start by ensuring you're in the directory we created before with our C runtime and linker script:

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/projects/riscv-uart
{% endhighlight %}

Now create a file called `ns16550a.s`, which will contain the code for our NS16550A UART driver.  In this file, let's start with a basic skeleton containing the functions we want to expose.  For now, we'll limit this driver to simply reading and writing chars, or bytes, without worrying about other available capabilities of the NS16550A, such as interrupts.

{% highlight nasm %}
.global uart_put_char
.global uart_get_char

uart_get_char:
    .cfi_startproc
    .cfi_endproc

uart_put_char:
    .cfi_startproc
    .cfi_endproc

.end
{% endhighlight %}

Walking through this, we use the `.global` assembler directive to declare `uart_put_char` and `uart_get_char` as symbols we want accessible to other object files that are linked with this one.  All lines that begin with `.`s are assembler directives, meaning they provide information to the assembler rather than acting as executable code.  A detailed description of all the basic GNU assembler directives can be found [here](https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gas-2.9.1/html_chapter/as_7.html).

Next, you'll see definitions of each of these symbols, currently only containing `.cfi` assembler directives.  These `.cfi` directives [inform tools](https://stackoverflow.com/a/33732119/2421349), such as the assembler or exception unwinder, about the structure of the frame and how to unwind it. `.cfi_startproc` and `.cfi_endproc` respectively signal the start and end of a function.

Finally we come to `.end`, which simply tells the assembler that this is the end of this file.

In the spirit of rapid iteration, let's try to compile this against our custom linker script and C runtime.  If you're curious to know what all these flags are for, they are described in [great detail in the previous post]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}#debugging-but-for-real-this-time).  For now, just know we are passing our custom linker script, `riscv64-virt.ld`, custom C runtime, `crt0.s`, and NS16550A driver, `ns16550a.s`, to GCC to compile, link, and assemble for us.

{% highlight bash %}
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -g -ffreestanding -O0 -Wl,--gc-sections \
    -nostartfiles -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -Wl,-T,riscv64-virt.ld \
    crt0.s ns16550a.s
{% endhighlight %}

This should result in the following error:

{% highlight bash %}
/Users/twilcock/usys/riscv/riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc-8.2.0-2019.02.0-x86_64-apple-darwin/bin/../lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-elf/8.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-elf/bin/ld: /var/folders/rg/hbr8vy7d13z9k7pdn0l_n9z51y1g13/T//ccjYQiJc.o: in function `.L0 ':
/Users/twilcock/projects/riscv-uart/crt0.s:12: undefined reference to `main'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
{% endhighlight %}

An utter disaster!  Taking a closer look at the error, this line tells us what we need to do:

{% highlight bash %}
/Users/twilcock/projects/riscv-uart/crt0.s:12: undefined reference to `main`
{% endhighlight %}

Taking a look at our `crt0.s` file, we do indeed see a reference to a symbol called `main`:

{% highlight bash %}
.section .init, "ax"
.global _start
_start:
    .cfi_startproc
    .cfi_undefined ra
    .option push
    .option norelax
    la gp, __global_pointer$
    .option pop
    la sp, __stack_top
    add s0, sp, zero
    jal zero, main # <~~~~~~~~~~
    .cfi_endproc
    .end
{% endhighlight %}

This is an easy fix - we simply need to link a file that defines the `main` symbol.  We would've wanted to do this anyways at some point, as we need some way to exercise our UART driver, and we can easily do so from `main`.  Create a new file called `main.c` in our working directory (`~/projects/riscv-uart`) and define a main function.  We'll also call `uart_put_char` to ensure that `main` is able to find our definition of it in `ns16550a.s`.

{% highlight c %}
int main() {
    uart_put_char();
}
{% endhighlight %}

And now try running `gcc` again, this time including `main.c`:

{% highlight bash %}
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -g -ffreestanding -O0 -Wl,--gc-sections \
    -nostartfiles -nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -Wl,-T,riscv64-virt.ld \
    crt0.s ns16550a.s main.c
{% endhighlight %}

And this results in success!  We now have a file in our working directory called `a.out`, which is our executable.  We can also use [`nm`](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/binutils/nm.html) to see all of the symbols we've defined so far, including the ones we just created, `main`, `uart_get_char`, and `uart_put_char`.  If you haven't already, make sure you have the `riscv64` version of `nm` installed and available on your path, or linked into your `/usr/local/bin` folder.  [This section]({% post_url 2019-04-27-riscv-from-scratch-2 %}#qemu-and-risc-v-toolchain-setup) in the first post in this series describes in detail how to accomplish this.

{% highlight bash %}
riscv64-unknown-elf-nm a.out

00000000800010a0 R __BSS_END__
000000008000109c R __DATA_BEGIN__
000000008000109c R __SDATA_BEGIN__
000000008000109c R __bss_start
000000008000189c A __global_pointer$
0000000088000000 T __stack_top
000000008000109c R _edata
00000000800010a0 R _end
0000000080000000 T _start
0000000080000018 T main
0000000080000018 T uart_get_char
0000000080000018 T uart_put_char
{% endhighlight %}

### Setting the base address

Again referencing [this resource](https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/serial-uart.html), NS16550A UARTs have twelve registers, each accessible from some number byte offset of the base address.  We will be digging into these registers to implement `uart_put_char` and `uart_get_char`, but first we'll need to define a symbol representing this base address for use in our driver.  As we discovered from the decompiled devicetree file above, `riscv64-virt.dts`, the base address is located at `0x00 + 0x10000000 = 0x10000000`, as that is what is in the `reg` property:

{% highlight bash %}
uart@10000000 {
    interrupts = <0x0a>;
    interrupt-parent = <0x02>;
    clock-frequency = <0x384000>;
    reg = <0x00 0x10000000 0x00 0x100>;
    compatible = "ns16550a";
};
{% endhighlight %}

Let's define this symbol in our linker script, `riscv64-virt.ld`, since this is a good place to put details specific to the `virt` machine:

{% highlight bash %}
...more above...
SECTIONS
{
  /* Read-only sections, merged into text segment: */
  PROVIDE (__executable_start = SEGMENT_START("text-segment", 0x10000));
  . = SEGMENT_START("text-segment", 0x10000) + SIZEOF_HEADERS;
  PROVIDE(__stack_top = ORIGIN(RAM) + LENGTH(RAM));
  /* >>>>>> Our newest addition. <<<<<< */
  PROVIDE(__uart_base_addr = 0x10000000);
  /* >>>>>> End of our addition. <<<<<< */
  .interp         : { *(.interp) }
...more below...
{% endhighlight %}

With our `__uart_base_addr` established and codified as a symbol, we'll now have easy access to the NS16550A registers from within our driver file, `ns16550a.s`.

### Next steps

Today we learned about UARTs and USARTs, the NS16550A specification, interrupts, and some additional devicetree properties.  We also have created a solid skeleton for our UART assembly driver, and have codified the `__uart_base_addr` as a symbol in our linker file for easy UART register access.

In the next post, we'll discuss and implement _function prologues_ for our two driver functions `uart_get_char` and `uart_put_char`.  Function prologues are an important part of making function calls possible in the world of assembly.  We will be walking through a function prologue step-by-step, with diagrams detailing changes to the stack and registers with every instruction.

When the next post is complete I'll link it here.  If you have any questions, comments, or corrections, feel free to [open up an issue](https://github.com/twilco/twilco.github.io/issues) or leave a comment below via [utterances](https://github.com/utterance/utterances).

Thanks for reading - hope to see you in the next post!
