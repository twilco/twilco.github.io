description: A detailed account of bug fixes I made in WebKit's CSS variables implementation.
---

Last year, I embarked on a mini-crusade to fix as many bugs in WebKit's CSS variables implementation as I could
find. While I did a fair amount of this work in my personal time, my employer, [Widen](https://www.widen.com/), was
kind enough to give me a few days off to work on this too.

I posted a write-up on this work for my company blog. This post is a brief and approachable view into the world of
browser development — you can see what the code looks like in the form of diffs, how testing works,
and the code review process. Check it out!
